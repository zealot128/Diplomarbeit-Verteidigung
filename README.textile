h1. Readme Deck.JS Builder

"Live example":http://zealot128.github.com/DeckJS-Builder/

This projects provide an easy working with the awesome Deck.js using Ruby, HAML and Compass.

Install:

<pre>
 git clone https://github.com/zealot128/DeckJS-Builder
 cd DeckJS-Builder
 bundle
 guard
</pre>

Then you can start editing:

* slides/*.haml  -> the main chapters
* views/*.haml   -> the layout, title and toc slide
* sass/screen.scss    -> The Stylings using Scss/Sass
* meta.yml  -> Title and author

Guard will automatically rebuild index.html and stylesheet when changed!

h2. Automatic toc

With javascript there will be an automatic toc created.
Just have a div#toc somewhere, and give your section.slide the additional class:

<pre>
  %section.slide.toc#custom-anchor
    %h1 Chapter Headline
  %section.slide.toc#another-custom-anchor
    %h2 Slide Headline
</pre>

Only slides that have the .toc class and a h1 or h2 will show up inside the toc.

IMPORTANT: Until now, this includes my work-in-progress thesis' defense
presentation, because I'am to lazy to put that one in a seperate repos :) Later
it will be extracted to have a clean empty presentation template
